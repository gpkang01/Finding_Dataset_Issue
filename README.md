## Finding_Dataset_Issue

1. In the beginnig, coding of repository "Image-Source-Data-Final-Processing" has some bugs.
   But many data were already processed by this.
   It made some overlapping instance names. And they caused some issues at their labelling.
2. main_jpg_space_json.py is to find these issues.
3. Its result will be used to resolve the issues and classify by class with final_classification.py.
